# Passtore
A simple desktop application that acts as a password manager by storing all passwords under a single master account.

**It is not intended to be used practically and was developed while I was learning SQL, databases and how to make UI using JavaFX. Passwords are stored in plain text in a database file so use at your own risk.**

UI may or may not run in some Linux distros depending on the DE used (ran on Ubuntu 18.04, but ElementaryOS showed broken stage and scene upon launch). Works fine on Windows 10.

Save file goes to C:\Users\ (yourname) on Windows, and  $USER/home on linux

**Required: Java 11 or above**

Used:

* Java 11
* SQLite
* JavaFX
